        <p>Organisers of Part 1 of the 30th Jesus Surf Classic, which took place at its traditional venue of Croyde in North Devon, were overjoyed to see a larger than predicted swell pushing into the bay from early in the morning on Saturday 17 September 2022.
            After deciding earlier on in the week that there would not be enough swell to run the whole of this large event in one weekend, Phil Williams, Contest Director, decided to split the event into two parts. This first part was very much focused on the groms, and separate categories for boys and girls were added in the Under 12 and Under 14 categories with great success.</p>

        <p>The volunteers, who have been key to the success of the contest over the last 30 years, worked hard on Friday to make sure that the contest site was ready for check in at 8 am on Saturday, when the BBQ was fired up, hot drinks were ready, and commemorative T-shirts and mugs were in the goody bags. The day started with a minuteâ€™s silence to reflect the passing of the Queen, which was a poignant way to start the 30th event.
            With just one peak being used throughout the day, progress was rapid and Enya and Lisa, who had volunteered to do water safety, did an amazing job ensuring that the line-up remained clear throughout the day. Thanks also go to Croyde RNLI who, as always, supported this event and gave their assistance should anything untoward have happened.</p>
